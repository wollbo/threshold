# threshold
A structured way of finding a tradeoff between positive and negative predictions in a binary setting. Given a set of predicted probabilities, an estimation of class balance and the respective costs associated with false positives/negatives, we can find an optimal threshold by minimizing the distance between our predictions and that of the true distribution.
