# threshold
A novel way of finding the tradeoff between positive and negative predictions in a binary setting is defined and explored using information theoretic principles. Given a set of predicted probabilities, an estimation of the class balance and the respective costs associated with false positives and false negatives, we can find an optimal threshold by minimizing the distance between our prediction distribution and the true class balance.
